<h3>RESEARCH PROCEDURES</h3>

This research is being conducted to understand the effects of psychological and environmental influences on 
decision-making. If you agree to participate, you will be asked to complete some surveys about your personality 
and participate in an online game similar to Jeopardy.  
</p>
<br>

<h3>RISKS</h3>

<p  style="font-size: 1.5em;" >There are no foreseeable risks for participating in this research.</p>
<br>

<h3>BENEFITS</h3>

<p  style="font-size: 1.5em;" >There are no direct benefits to participants.<br>
<br>


<h3>CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
<br>

<p  style="font-size: 1.5em;" >The data in this study will be confidential.  Through the use of your worker id, the researcher will be able to pay you for participation.  No personally identifiable information will be linked to your responses. Following data collection, all worker ids will be removed from the data and replaced by an alphanumeric code. While it is understood that no computer transmission can be perfectly secure, reasonable efforts will be made to protect the confidentiality of your transmission.
<br>

<h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
<br>


<p  style="font-size: 1.5em;" >
This study is open to participants age 18 and  older. This study will take approximately 1 hour to complete. Your participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. If you decide not to participate or if you withdraw from the study, there is no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. There are no costs to you or any other party. Upon completion of both the survey measures and the decision-making task, you will receive cash in the amount listed on the Mechanical Turk site; payment will be dispensed through Amazon.  You have the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to $2.00 for your level of performance on the tasks.
